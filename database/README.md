# Database Directory

This directory contains the SQLite database files for the Dragon Ball Finality bot.

- `dragonball.db` - Main database file (auto-created)
- Database is automatically initialized on first run
- Contains tables for users, characters, forms, combat state, etc.

The database file itself is excluded from git to prevent conflicts, but the directory structure is preserved.
