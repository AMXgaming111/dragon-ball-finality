# Dragon Ball Finality - Common Techniques System Implementation Summary

## üéØ Implementation Overview
The Common Techniques system has been fully implemented according to official game specifications. This system provides 9 unique techniques available to all characters, with 4 free techniques and 5 that cost 4 ki each (unaffected by Control stat).

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema
### New Table: `technique_effects`
```sql
CREATE TABLE technique_effects (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    character_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    channel_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    technique_name TEXT NOT NULL,        -- e.g., 'clear_mind', 'guard', etc.
    effect_type TEXT NOT NULL,           -- e.g., 'control_bonus', 'damage_reduction'
    effect_value TEXT NOT NULL,          -- Numeric value as string
    target_character_id INTEGER,         -- For targeted effects like Grab
    turns_remaining INTEGER NOT NULL,    -- Duration of effect
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## ‚ö° Implemented Techniques (Correct Specifications)

### **FREE TECHNIQUES** (No Ki Cost)

### 1. **Clear Mind** (`cmind`) - FREE
- **Effect:** +30 Control until end of next turn
- **Mechanical Implementation:** Stores `control_bonus` effect for 2 turns
- **Usage:** `!attack cmind` - Mental focus for improved ki control

### 2. **Guard** (`guard`) - FREE  
- **Effect:** 20% damage reduction until start of next turn
- **Mechanical Implementation:** Stores `damage_reduction` effect for 1 turn
- **Usage:** `!attack guard` - Defensive stance with damage protection

### 3. **Heavy Blow** (`hblow`) - FREE
- **Effect:** Normal attack + target gets -20% agility debuff if damaged
- **Mechanical Implementation:** Stores `agility_debuff` (0.8x) on target for 1 turn
- **Usage:** `!attack hblow @target` - Powerful attack that slows enemies

### 4. **Feint** (`feint`) - FREE
- **Effect:** Normal attack + target dodge rolls get -0.5x penalty
- **Mechanical Implementation:** Attack data includes dodge penalty modifier
- **Usage:** `!attack feint @target` - Deceptive attack that bypasses dodges

### **KI TECHNIQUES** (4 Ki Each, Unaffected by Control)

### 5. **Weakpoint** (`wpoint`) - 4 ki
- **Effect:** -0.3x strength penalty, but deals 7% max health if not fully defended
- **Mechanical Implementation:** Special percentage damage calculation
- **Usage:** `!attack wpoint @target` - Precision strike for guaranteed damage

### 6. **Chokehold** (`chold`) - 4 ki
- **Effect:** Normal attack + target loses 8% ki if damaged
- **Mechanical Implementation:** On-damage effect for ki drain
- **Usage:** `!attack chold @target` - Grappling attack with ki drain

### 7. **Grab** (`grab`) - 4 ki
- **Effect:** Target must pass Strength vs Strength to dodge (doesn't end turn)
- **Mechanical Implementation:** Stores `grab_effect` with attacker's strength
- **Usage:** `!attack grab @target` - Control technique that restricts movement

### 8. **Double Strike** (`dstrike`) - 4 ki
- **Effect:** Roll twice for damage, add together; dodge penalties apply per roll
- **Mechanical Implementation:** Dual damage rolls with special dodge mechanics
- **Usage:** `!attack dstrike @target` - High-damage burst technique

### 9. **Counter** (`counter`) - 4 ki
- **Effect:** -0.2x strength penalty, unblockable and undodgeable
- **Restriction:** Only usable when last attacker dealt no damage
- **Mechanical Implementation:** Special attack type with no-defense properties
- **Usage:** `!attack counter @target` - Reactive technique for skilled fighters

## üîß Core Functions Added

### In `calculations.js`:
```javascript
// Add technique effects to database
addTechniqueEffect(database, characterId, channelId, techniqueName, effectType, effectValue, targetId, turns)

// Retrieve active effects for a character
getTechniqueEffects(database, characterId, channelId)

// Calculate effective stats with technique modifications
calculateEffectiveStats(database, characterId, channelId, baseStats)

// Calculate damage reduction from defensive techniques
calculateTechniqueDamageReduction(database, characterId, channelId)
```

### In `attack.js`:
- **Complete UI System:** Interactive button selection for all 9 techniques
- **Proper Ki Validation:** Free techniques have no checks, 4ki techniques validate cost
- **Effect Storage:** All techniques store their effects in the database
- **Visual Feedback:** Rich embeds showing accurate technique effects and costs

## üéÆ User Interface
- **Two-Tier Selection:** Physical ‚Üí Attack/Technique ‚Üí Individual Techniques
- **Clear Descriptions:** Each technique shows effects, costs, and accurate game mechanics
- **Ki Management:** Real-time ki cost validation for paid techniques only
- **Visual Indicators:** Color-coded embeds differentiating free vs paid techniques

## üîÑ Integration Points
- **Combat System:** Techniques integrate seamlessly with attack/defend mechanics
- **Turn Management:** Effects persist correctly with turn-based countdown
- **Stat Calculations:** Control bonuses and debuffs modify character performance
- **Database Persistence:** All effects survive bot restarts and session changes

## ‚úÖ Testing Results
The comprehensive test confirms:
- ‚úÖ Database schema creation successful
- ‚úÖ Effect storage and retrieval working correctly
- ‚úÖ Proper ki cost implementation (free vs 4ki)
- ‚úÖ Stat modification calculations functional  
- ‚úÖ Damage reduction system operational (20% not 50%)
- ‚úÖ Control bonus effects working (+30 not +15)

## üöÄ Game Balance Notes
- **Free Techniques:** Provide basic tactical options without resource cost
- **4 Ki Techniques:** Powerful effects requiring resource management
- **Control Independence:** Ki costs unaffected by Control stat as intended
- **Turn Management:** Effects properly timed for strategic gameplay

## üìã Usage Examples
```
!attack @target                    # Basic physical attack
!attack cmind                      # Clear Mind (+30 Control, FREE)
!attack guard                      # Guard (20% damage reduction, FREE)
!attack hblow @target              # Heavy Blow (agility debuff, FREE)
!attack feint @target              # Feint (dodge penalty, FREE)
!attack wpoint @target             # Weakpoint (7% health damage, 4 ki)
!attack chold @target              # Chokehold (8% ki drain, 4 ki)
!attack grab @target               # Grab (strength vs dodge, 4 ki)
!attack dstrike @target            # Double Strike (roll twice, 4 ki)
!attack counter @target            # Counter (unblockable, 4 ki)
```

## üéØ Key Implementation Features
- **Specification Compliance:** Exactly matches provided technique descriptions
- **Cost Structure:** Free techniques vs flat 4ki costs as specified
- **Effect Accuracy:** Correct percentages and mechanics (20% guard, 30 control, etc.)
- **Turn Duration:** Proper effect timing ("until end of next turn" vs "until start")
- **Resource Management:** Ki costs unaffected by Control stat
- **Combat Integration:** Works seamlessly with existing combat systems

The Common Techniques system is now fully operational and specification-compliant!
